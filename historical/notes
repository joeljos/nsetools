given a folder containing csv files with column headers as : "DATE,SERIES,OPEN,HIGH,LOW,PREV. CLOSE,LTP,CLOSE,VWAP,52W H,52W L,VOLUME,VALUE,NO OF TRADES,SYMBOL", each csv file contains one symbol each. I want a python code to do stochastic oscillator for all the symbols as on a particular date. The lookback period can be adjustable with default being 14 days. i also want the oscillator values to be checked for uptrend (previous day value less than current day value) and finally have all the uptrending values sorted in ascending order along with the details of the associated symbols in a single final csv file output.

rm -rf *.csv
